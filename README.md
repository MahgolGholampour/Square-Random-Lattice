# Square-Random-Lattice
In this series of codes we can make a random lattice with an arbitrary size. The bigger the lattice, the more accurate parameters and critical exponents we have.
This lattice can be labeled. It means that neighbor sites(neraest neighbors) which have similar numbers gain similar labels.
